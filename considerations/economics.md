### Biographies

**Dr. Chiente Hsu**: Dr. Chiente Hsu is CEO and co-founder of ALEX, the flagship DeFi on Bitcoin via Stacks. Dr. Hsu joins ALEX from Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, where she was a Managing Director and Global Head of Quant Research. She is also the author of ‘Rule Based Investing”, published by FT Press. Dr. Hsu spent her early career in academia. She was a tenure-track professor at the University of Vienna, Austria, and a visiting professor at Duke University, where she taught and conducted research in Financial Econometrics.

**MattySTX (Chairperson)**: Matty has more than a decade of experience designing, simulating, and optimizing economic models for hedge funds and VC funded machine learning startups. He has been in crypto since 2015, and Stacks since 2017. In the Stacks ecosystem, his simulation analysis of Stacks’ economic model has helped evaluate PoX consensus mechanism improvements, he authored the first ever community contributed governance proposal for Arkadiko’s tokenomics, he publishes the quarterly ‘STX Mining Report’, and he mentors teams at the Stacks incubator.

**Xan Ditkoff**: Xan became part of the Stack’s ecosystem in 2017 as an early core team member focused on growing the developer ecosystem. He now runs Daemon Technologies, a Hong Kong based company focused on community growth, project funding, and partnerships for Stack’s technology primarily in Asia.

## About this CAB

The economics CAB reviews SIPs related to the blockchain's token economics. This not only includes the STX token, but also any on-chain tokens created within smart contracts. SIPs that are concerned with fundraising methods, grants, bounties, and so on also belong in this SIP track.

## Considerations

### In-scope

The following items would be considered in-scope for this CAB:

1. Changes to the tokenomics of Stacks or the STX token itself
2. Changes to Stacks’ consensus mechanism - particularly with regard to the impact on miners and stackers
3. The economic impacts, and risks of economic impacts, that changes to the Stacks protocol would have on any and all parties in the Stacks ecosystem
4. The economic soundness and viability of proposed standards for fungible or non-fungible tokens issued on STX
5. Changes that put the existing economy on the Stacks chain at risk, or which may grow/shrink Stacks’ overall economic utility and activity
6. Any economic impact or risk to native Bitcoin due to Stacks’ activity

### Out-of-scope

The following items would be considered out-of-scope for this CAB:

1. The security of the Stacks network itself, beyond the economic risks and impacts of its ongoing security
2. The particular tokenomics of any given project launching on Stacks
3. The technical or implementation-level aspects of changes to the tokenomics of Stacks, the STX token itself, or Stack’s consensus mechanism (though any relative economic differences in technical approaches would be in-scope for this CAB)
4. Improvements to the speed, performance, up-time, or other functioning of the Stacks network itself, other than any economic impacts or risks created by these changes

### Questions for SIP Review

Questions to facilitate SIP review:

1. Which stakeholders are expected to be economically impacted, or at-risk of being economically impacted, by this SIP (ex. miners, stackers, STX holders, STX users, founders/builders, etc)?
2. What are the expected economic impacts to each of these stakeholders?
3. What are the economic and non-economic risks to each of these stakeholders?
4. Do the expected economic benefits outweigh the economic and non-economic risks for each of these stakeholders?
5. If one stakeholder would economically benefit at the expense of another stakeholder (for example increase profit to miners at cost of reducing yield to stackers), what is the expected overall economic net impact to Stacks and the Stacks ecosystem?

_Note: above considerations subject to changes and iterations from ongoing lessons learned_

## Bylaws

We choose to adopt the bylaws Steering Committee member @jcnelson set out in this doc: https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/3fcc635ede20ce98d1eae60941eb127a

Starting form those bylaws, this CAB will continue to evaluate what works, what doesn't work, and use the feedback and lessons learned to improve the process and increase involvement along the way.
