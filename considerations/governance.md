### Biographies

**Harold Davis**: Started in the Blockstack ecosystem back in 2016. Became very involved with governance in 2020 with the governance working group. Established a governance residency focused on R+D of gov tooling for the Stacks Advocates & ecosystem. Specifically focused on distributed power for long term sustainability.

**Juliet Oberding**: Juliet is a long time member of the Stacks community. She participated in App Mining, was an original member of the Governance working group, developed the Stacks Code of Conduct and was a resident with the Stacks Gov Lab. Her background is as a lawyer, law professor and founder of a digital health startup. Juliet is currently the founder of Lexy Lab, a startup focused on governance research.

**Orlando Cosme**: Orlando first got involved in Stacks when mainnet launched. He is the co-founder & CEO of StackerDAO Labs, a startup that develops infrastructure and tools to create and manage DAOs on Stacks. He is also a lawyer and had stints as a startup/VC corporate lawyer and a securities and government enforcement litigator. Through StackerDAOs and as an attorney, he has developed both on-chain, decentralized governance structures, as well as traditional corporate governance structures. He has also worked on corporate governance disputes.

**Zero.btc**: Zero has been involved with the Stacks community since the BlockStack days and he learned about Stacks during the regulated ICO. He is the co-founder of Zero Authority DAO, and he and his co-founder Hodlstx created the Cerulean Marketplace for creators and builders to offer a service and for people to pay for Web3 gigs in a trustless and permissionless way. Being a part of the governance CAB is an honor and he has spent lots of time working on governance for the DAO they have built.

**Jason Schrader (Chairperson)**: Stacks community member since 2019, engineer at Freehold and a core developer of the CityCoins protocol. Participated in the formation of the Stacks Governance Working Group and helps with research, tooling, and project management. An open source advocate and teacher at heart - we're all learning together!

## About this CAB

The governance CAB concerns the governance of the Stacks blockchain, including the SIP process. This includes amendments to the SIP Ratification Process, as well as structural considerations such as the creation (or removal) of various committees, editorial bodies, and formally recognized special interest groups. In addition, governance SIPs may propose changes to the way by which committee members are selected.

## Considerations

### In-scope

The following items would be considered in-scope for this CAB:

1. changes to the SIP process
2. changes to the way we represent blockchain stakeholders
3. changes to the code of conduct
4. changes to the way we organize Stacks chapters
5. changes to voting/decision making processes
6. changes to community representative to board
7. changes that impact community members
8. changes that impact all STX holders/investors

### Out-of-scope

The following items would be considered out-of-scope for this CAB:

1. The security of the Stacks network itself, beyond the governance risks and impacts of its ongoing security.
2. The particular governance of any given project launching on Stacks
3. Improvements to the speed, performance, up-time, or other functioning of the Stacks network itself, other than any governance impacts or risks created by these changes

### Questions for SIP Review

Questions to facilitate SIP review:

1. Which stakeholders' governance processes are expected to be impacted, or at-risk of being impacted, by this SIP (ex. miners, stackers, STX holders, STX users, STX builders, etc)?
2. What are the expected governance impacts to each of these parties?
3. What are the governance and non-governance risks to each of these parties?
4. Do the expected governance benefits outweigh the governance and non-governance risks for each of these parties?
5. If one party would benefit in decision making power at the expense of another party (for example increase decision making power to miners at cost of less decision making to stackers), what is the likely overall, net decision making power impact to Stacks and the Stacks ecosystem?

_Note: above considerations subject to changes and iterations from ongoing lessons learned_

## Bylaws

We choose to adopt the bylaws Steering Committee member @jcnelson set out in this doc: https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/3fcc635ede20ce98d1eae60941eb127a

Starting form those bylaws, this CAB will continue to evaluate what works, what doesn't work, and use the feedback and lessons learned to improve the process and increase involvement along the way.
