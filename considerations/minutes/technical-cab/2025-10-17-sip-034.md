## 2025-10-15 Meeting Notes

Note: This vote was urgently needed to ensure it can proceed together with
SIP-033. The current chair, Jesse Wiley, is unavailable for this vote, so Brice
Dobry is acting chair for this vote.

The Technical CAB reviewed SIP-034 and the supporting materials, and concluded
that this change is necessary to support the ecosystem.
