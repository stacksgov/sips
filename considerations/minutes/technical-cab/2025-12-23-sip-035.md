## 2025-12-22 Meeting Notes

The Technical CAB reviewed SIP-034 as a documentation update based on a discrepancy in SIP-033 for
the `secp256r1-verify` function added in Clarity 4 and the actual behavior implemented and activated in Epoch 3.3, and concluded
that this change is necessary to support the ecosystem.
