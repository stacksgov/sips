## About this SIP Editor Committee

The role of a SIP Editor is to identify SIPs in the Draft status and help transition them to Accepted status. A SIP editor must be able to vet a SIP to ensure that it is well-formed, that it follows the ratification workflow faithfully, and that it does not overlap with any already-Accepted SIPs or SIPs that have since become Recommended or Ratified.

The SIP Editors are responsible for maintaining the "inbound funnel" for SIPs from the greater Stacks community. SIP Editors ensure that all inbound SIPs are well-formed, relevant, and do not duplicate prior work (including rejected SIPs).

SIP Editors should be open and welcoming towards enthusiastic users who want to help improve the greater Stacks ecosystem. As such, SIP Editors should encourage users to submit SIPs if they have good ideas that may be worth implementing.

In addition, SIP Editors should respond to public requests for help from community members who want to submit a SIP. They may point them towards this document, or towards other supplemental documents and tools to help them get started.
